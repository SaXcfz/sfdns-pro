An advanced, lightweight, privacy-focused Android application for changing DNS servers and tunneling DNS queries securely via **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**. Built natively with Kotlin and Android `VpnService` to capture DNS traffic and forward it to chosen resolvers with zero battery drain.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🛡️ **Privacy First & Secure DoH**: Supports encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) queries to prevent DNS spoofing, eavesdropping, and ISP hijacking.
- ⚡ **Lightweight Local VPN Routing**: Captures only DNS traffic (port 53 UDP/TCP). Other internet traffic is not routed through the app.
- 🚀 **Pre-configured Anti-Sanction & Fast Servers**:
  - **Cloudflare** (`1.1.1.1`)
  - **Google Public DNS** (`8.8.8.8`)
  - **Quad9** (`9.9.9.9`)
  - **Shecan** (`178.22.122.100`)
  - **Electro** (`78.157.42.100`)
  - **Radar Game** (`10.201.201.201`)
  - **403 Online** (`10.202.10.202`)
  - **Begzar** (`185.55.226.26`)
  - **Custom Primary & Secondary DNS** input support (IPv4 & IPv6)
- 🧩 **Home Screen Widgets & Quick Tile**: Toggle DNS connection from the Quick Settings tile or from interactive app widgets.
- 🎨 **Modern Cyber Aesthetic UI**: Smooth animations, dark mode, ping test indicators, and real-time DNS status feedback.
- 🔄 **Auto-Connect on Boot**: Optional background startup after device reboot.
- 🎮 **Gaming Radar Benchmark**: Real UDP/TCP socket-based ping measuring lowest latency for online games.
- 🛡️ **Split Tunneling (App Bypass)**: Selectively bypass banking or domestic apps from DNS routing.

## 🏗️ Architecture & How It Works

1. **Android VpnService Loop**: The app establishes a local virtual TUN interface (`VpnService`). Instead of routing all traffic, it selectively intercepts DNS destinations on port 53.
2. **DNS Packet Draining & DoH Processing**: When DoH is enabled, captured DNS queries are converted into RFC 8484-compliant HTTPS requests sent over TLS to the selected resolver (e.g. `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query`).
3. **Zero Logs & Minimal Footprint**: The app avoids persistent logging and does not transmit telemetry to third parties.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SFDNSAPP/sfdns-pro/releases) or website.
2. Open the app and grant the VPN permission when prompted.
3. Choose a resolver from the list or enter custom Primary/Secondary DNS addresses.
4. Enable DoH in settings if you want encrypted DNS (recommended).
5. Use the Quick Settings tile or widget for one-tap connect/disconnect.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this app route all my traffic through a VPN?**  
A: No. The app only intercepts DNS queries (port 53) and forwards them to the configured resolver. Other traffic uses the device's normal network path.

**Q: Is my DNS traffic logged or shared?**  
A: No. The app aims for minimal footprint and does not persistently log DNS queries or send telemetry to third parties.

**Q: Will this work on rooted devices or older Android versions?**  
A: The app uses Android's standard `VpnService` and works on devices with Android 7.0+ (API level 24+). Root is NOT required.
